Assignment 2 - Protege for Ontology


Hi,  This is an assignment all of you should be doing. I have attached a good manual on Protege written by another FAU graduate student. Use the PDF version, not the Word version of the tutorial attached. Please download Protege and try out the Pizza example. I cover this in my last lecture of 5/15, scheduled for this Wed (tomorrow). I have given you links to three sets of pedometer type of data (see the second attachment). You are welcome to pick any of them (only one). However, unlike the previous assignment on .csv data, here the focus is on the 'data dictionary' - you will notice two data files at all of these links. I found that ''Data Set Description' link does not work; but if you click on the first link for ' Data Folder', you will find a file with data descriptions. Study the document - typically, there are about 100+ variables listed. Reflect on them and create a taxonomy (class hierarchy) using Protege. Create 5 data instances (or individuals) by pulling any 5 data sets from the associated database (that is, five rows of data).

This assignment is just to get experience using Protege. It is central to everything we will do with the semantic web.  So, I urge all of you to do this assignment. Later on, you will learn SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) and will learn how best to map your taxonomy and rules to that overarching ontology. For now, learn Protege and map your chosen data dictionary to a taxonomy. Do not be concerned about adding data properties and object properties at present. Just make sure you completely go over the Pizza tutorial (no proof is required) and then build your taxonomy for one of the data sets. Submit the latter in .owl format at Github. You should be able to find your repo here (but for 2 students who have not responded so far): https://github.com/Semantic-Web .

Submit it in a separate folder at your Github Repo entitled as "Assignment 2"
